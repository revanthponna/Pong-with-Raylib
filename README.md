# Pong-with-Raylib
* In this project, I created the well known Pong game using the Raylib game library with C++ programming.
* Used core Object Oriented Programming (OOPs) concepts to design the game scene and elements to be displayed.
* Added extra features to the Pong game such as increasing the speed with every collision and making the ball bounce off at different angles depending on where it hits the paddles.
